## Agenda
The `agenda` command is a little special since it offers diverse options in order to ease its use.

### Listing weeks
You can list and select the week to display by using the `-i` option (alias of `--interactive`).

### Manual week selection
It's possible to manually specify the wanted week. Here's some possibilities:
- `myges agenda 19-03-2020` -> Shows the week from last Sunday to next Sunday of the date `19-03-2020`
- `myges agenda 19-03` -> Shows the week from last Sunday to next Sunday of `March 19` of the current year
- `myges agenda 19` -> Shows the week from last Sunday to next Sunday of the day `19` of the current month and year
- `myges agenda today` -> Displays today's agenda
- `myges agenda tomorrow` -> Displays tomorrow's agenda
- `myges agenda yesterday` -> Displays yesterday's agenda

A shifting can be added to the specified week:
- `myges agenda today+2` -> Shows the agenda of 2 days from today
- `myges agenda today+-2` -> Shows the agenda of 2 days ago from today

Those shifts can be applied to any manual week input using the same format (`+n`).

## Project management
Using the CLI, you can list available projects and project groups.
You can also join or quit a project group.

- `myges projects` -> List available projects
- `myges project <id>` -> Give information about the selected project (replace *`<id>`* by the actual group's id given in the projects list)
- `myges project <id> groups` -> List available groups for the specified project
- `myges project <id> join [group]` -> Join a group. You can specify the group by replacing the optional *`[group]`* argument, else it will prompt a selector
- `myges project <id> quit` -> Quit the current group you're in. A confirmation will be required before executing the request

## Calendar Sync

This command allows you to syncronize your calendar on goocle calendar (and thus no longer use the myges planning!).

- `myges calendar-sync <days>` -> Sync google calendar from today to given number of days
- `myges calendar-sync --reset_credentials` -> Reset google credentials and ask it again
- `myges calendar-sync --reset_calendar` -> Reset google calendar ID and ask it again
- You need to setup few things before using this script.

### Setup Google API

To make the script work, you need to create a google calendar API and save its information like this :

* Go to [https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/php](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/php)
* Create a Google Calendar API project

|                                           |                                           |

* Save the `credentials.json` file, you will need information inside it at first time.

### Create new Google Calendar

> :warning: Be sure to create a calendar dedicated ONLY to your schedule! Otherwise the script will delete the other events present in your calendar ...

To retrieve your calendar id:

* Go to https://calendar.google.com

* Go to "Settings and sharing" of the calendar dedicated to your planning

* You will find the id of your calendar in the section "Integrate the calendar"

### First launch

At the first launch, you will be asked to enter the various information that you have configured before.

If this is the first connection, follow the terminal's instructions to retrieve the `google connection token`

> When you click on the Google url, don't forget to copy the given authorization token and paste it into the CLI
